Two years ago at our company offsite, we had everyone stand in a big circle and 
introduce themselves in front of the entire company (in justsentenceor two)
Even though everything was done efficiently, it still took quite a while! Similarly, 
when passing out the latest T-shirt or water bottle to celebrate a company milestone, 
it can sometimes take a while to get things passed out. 

Our marketing team pitched a new way of trying to distribute the next t-shirt at the
next offsite, and came up with a plan - given everyone was going to be in a big circle
 anyway, why not just pass things out there? With a few peogle given a box of coffee 
mugs to start with, each person would take turns, if they had more than one mug 
passing one to the person to their left, and one to the person to their right, with 
success declared when everyone had one [or, if the wrong number of items were made, 
some poor unfortunates ended up with none). 

They tasked engineering with figuring out how long it would take, if each pass took
 one second. We're passing the task along to you! 

Input consists of two lines; the first is the number of employees that will be present,
 and the second is a space-delimited set of values of the number of mugs that the 
person at that position start with.
For example, with the input:
6

0 0 2 3 0 0

The final answer would be 8 seconds, since 8 moves are required
